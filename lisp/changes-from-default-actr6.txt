Here are listed the changes made to the ACT-R 6 source files to make
it all fly correctly with CogTool. Modulo whatever changes or fixes
are made in ACT-R itself, they will have to be propagated to any
updated versions we take.

There used to be a lot of changes required. Because (a) Dan has kindly
merged much of what is needed to make ACT-R run under CLisp back into
the main ACT-R sources, and (b) I've figured out more ways of fiddling
what we emit to cope with things we used to change ACT-R to do differently,
very few of these changes remain necessary. All that's left are:

- directories we don't need are removed: docs, tutorial, test-models,
  testing-modules and environment; and the acl and mcl subdirctories
  of devices

- remove environment-loader.lisp from the tools directory
