Installation on Unix:
---------------------

This file describes the standard installation procedure.
Please do read this entire file before starting
- or, if you are impatient, start with step 12.
Special hints for some platforms can be found in file unix/PLATFORMS.

1. (Optional)
   Choose which C compiler to use for building CLISP.
   This is normally not necessary; if GNU C is available under the
   name "gcc", it will be used.

   For example, if you were wanting to use gcc with full warnings, then
   type, if you are using csh:

         setenv CC "gcc -Wall"

   or if you are using bash or ksh:

         export CC="gcc -Wall"

   or if you are using sh:

         CC="gcc -Wall"
         export CC

2. (Recommended)
   Install a few libraries on which CLISP relies:
   * GNU libsigsegv
      + Highly recommended: needed for generational garbage collection
        and for stack overflow detection in interpreted Lisp code.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libsigsegv/>
      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libsigsegv/>
   * GNU libiconv
      + Not needed on systems with glibc 2.2 or newer, or MacOS X 10.3 or
        newer, but recommended on all other systems.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/>
      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libiconv/>
   * GNU readline
      + Recommended: needed if you want terminal command line editing.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/>
      <http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html>
      Note that readline-5.0 is broken; if you want to use it, you need
      the patches named bash30-002, bash30-005, bash30-006, bash30-009,
      bash30-011, available from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/>.
   * GNU gettext
      + Not needed on systems with glibc 2.2 or newer, but recommended on all
        other systems: needed if you want clisp with native language support.
      <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/>
      <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>

   When you install your libraries in a non-standard location, you will
   need to tell the location to the top-level configure, e.g.:
   ./configure --with-libreadline-prefix=/sw               \
               --with-libsigsegv-prefix=/usr/local         \
               --with-libiconv-prefix=/home/user/my/prefix \
               --build my-build-directory

3. Choose the name of a directory in which to build CLISP.
   (This allows you to build CLISP with different compilers on the same
   machine or for different architectures in the same filesystem, sharing
   the same source.)
   For example, depending on the chosen compiler, let's use build-with-gcc.
   Then execute

         ./configure build-with-gcc

   This will prepare a directory build-with-gcc/ and figure out many
   system and compiler dependent parameters needed by CLISP.

   (Note: Some `make's - for example the HP-UX make - have problems
   with symbolic links. You may avoid these by calling

         ./configure

   without argument. Then CLISP will be built in the src/ directory
   itself.)

   Note that the argument to configure can be an absolute pathname.
   For example, the following command will also work.

         ./configure /tmp/with-gcc-wall

4. The previous step printed a recommendation how to continue. Follow
   the recommendation: Go to this directory

         cd with-gcc-wall

   and build the makefile that controls compilation:

         ./makemake > Makefile

   If you wish to compile the sources so that you can debug them,
   then type instead:

         ./makemake debug > Makefile

   The makemake command also accepts a couple of --with-PACKAGE options.
   To get a list of the supported options, try

         ./makemake --help

5. If you wish to build CLISP with add-on modules, edit Makefile and change
   the line defining the MODULES variable.
   The list of modules included with the distribution is available via
         ./configure --list-modules

6. Type

         make config.lisp

   and edit the contents of config.lisp appropriately for your site,
   especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.

   If you have unpacked some add-on modules (see the main INSTALL file for
   a list), you may choose to build clisp with them. Just add the module
   directories to the line defining MODULES in the makefile.

   For platform specific adjustment of the makefile, take a look at the
   PLATFORMS file.

7. Type

         make

   to build CLISP.
   If you are an expert in building CLISP, you may alternatively do this
   in eight steps:
         make init                prepares all symbolic links and utilities
         make allc                makes all *.c files
         make lisp.run            makes the executable
         make interpreted.mem     a memory image with everything uncompiled
         make halfcompiled.mem    a memory image with compiler.fas and
                                  the rest uncompiled
         make lispinit.mem        makes all *.fas files and
                                  a memory image with everything compiled
         make manual              makes the documentation
         make modular             makes the base module set (only needed
                                  if --with-dynamic-ffi was specified)

   If something goes wrong, check and optionally modify the contents of
   the file unixconf.h and retry this step. Yes, there are many warnings,
   we know. Most of them are harmless.

   If you need to switch to a different compiler, execute a
         make distclean
         cd ..
   and go back to step 1.

8. (Optionally)
   Three more tests for CLISP. Let the compiler (now compiled!) recompile
   itself:

         make check-recompile

   Check whether CLISP passes the XCL/CLISP test suite:

         make check-tests

   Check whether CLISP passes the Minejima/SACLA test suite:

         make check-sacla-tests

   Check whether CLISP passes the Dietz/GCL test suite:

         make check-ansi-tests

   Or run all four tests with one shot:

         make check

   If you build with some modules, you can test those of them that come
   with a test suite with:

         make mod-check

   Note that the modules may use external libraries, and test failures
   may indicate bugs in those libraries rather than in CLISP.
   See the specific test suite for detail.

9. Edit the `prefix' variable in the makefile (you could also have specified
   it as command line option --prefix=... to `configure' in step 3), then type

         make install

   If `prefix' is /usr/local, then this will install the CLISP binaries
   into /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib (creating a directory
   /usr/local/lib/clisp) and the manual page into /usr/local/man/man1.
   You may need superuser privileges for this step when installing into
   public directories.
   If you built with modules (e.g., ./configure --with-module=rawsock)
   there will be two "linking sets" in /usr/local/lib/clisp/ - "base"
   and "full" (see <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes.html#modules>).
   You can chose which linking set to run by using "-K" option of clisp
   (see <http://clisp.cons.org/clisp.html#opt-link-set>)
   Note that some modules (i18n, regexp and syscalls at this time)
   are included in the "base" linking set by default,
   see BASE_MODULES in build-dir/Makefile.

10. If you want other people to benefit from your work, you can make a binary
   distribution of CLISP for your platform which we will distribute.
   To do this, make sure you have executed step 7 above,
   adjust the definition of ROFF_MAN in the makefile,
   then type

         make distrib

   to create a binary distribution in a clisp-*.tar.gz file.
   Tell us about your success, and make that file available to us.

   If you want to distribute the binaries, recall that you have to accompany
   them with full source; see the files COPYING and GNU-GPL.

11. The last thing to do:

         cd ..

12. If you are lazy and have too few spare neurons to remember this long
    process, just use the shortcut, like I do:

         ./configure --with-module=rawsock --build build-dir

    this covers the build process through step 8 (except mod-check).
    You will need to become root to do the install.
